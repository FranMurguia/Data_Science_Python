Let's take a look at those p-values for a moment though, because they are saying things that can inform experimental design down the road. For instance, the assignment 3, has a p-value around 0.1. This means if we accepted a level of chance similarity of 11% this would have considered statistically significant. As a research, this would suggest to me that there is something here worth considering following up on.
